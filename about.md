I’m an Agile certified fullstack developer based in IBM’s Rapid Prototyping team, working early in the pre-sales stage to use a “show not tell” approach with clients.

My main skills are in Node.js (with Vue.js) on IBM Cloud, using Cloudant/MongoDB or SQL. Additional project experience with React, Hyperledger Composer & DB2. Basic proficiency in Java, Python, PHP, and with AWS. I have a strong interest in dev/ops, CI/CD, TDD & automation.

From 2015-2019 I was studying part time at Queen Mary University of London as part of IBM's Degree Apprenticeship scheme pilot, where I achieved first class honours.

I was the winner of 2017 South East Degree Apprentice of the Year, Highly commended 2017 National Apprentice of the Year. I finished in the final 10 for both 2016 and 2018 TargetJobs Apprentice of the Year awards, and in the final 10 in the BCS IT Apprentice of the Year.
