I’m an Agile certified fullstack developer based in IBM’s Rapid Prototyping team, working early in the pre-sales stage to use a “show not tell” approach with clients.

My main skills are in Node.js (with Vue.js) on IBM Cloud, using Cloudant/MongoDB or SQL, using a TDD approach with something like Mocha. I have Additional project experience with React, Hyperledger Composer & DB2 and basic proficiency in Java, Python, PHP, and with AWS. I have a strong interest in dev/ops, CI/CD, TDD & automation.

From 2015-2019 I was studying part time for a degree in Computer Science with Business at Queen Mary University London, as part of the pilot for IBM's Degree Apprenticeship Scheme. I'm due to graduate with First Class Honours in July 2019.

I was the winner of 2017 South East Degree Apprentice of the Year, Highly commended 2017 National Apprentice of the Year. I finished in the final 10 for both 2016 and 2018 TargetJobs Apprentice of the Year awards, and in the final 10 in the BCS IT Apprentice of the Year.
