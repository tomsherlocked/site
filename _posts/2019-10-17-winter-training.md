Ok, it's time to get set up for the winter. Summer 2019 got me way more into riding for fitness, and I'm hoping to have a better 2020. I usually commit everything to a new training plan, overtrain, then end up [massively underachieving](https://tomsherlock.info/2018/02/01/strava-dash.html) due to injury. I'd like to __not__ do that this time, so touch wood things will be ok!

For this winter, I've decided to keep things simple and (hopefully) realistic. Over the summer I was fitting in 1 or 2 shorter interval sessions during the week (usually an hour on road), a long road ride each weekend then a recovery mountain bike ride. Since getting a decent spec mountain bike, I've been swapping out the longer road ride for a longer MTB ride. I want to keep this up, whilst reamaining under the threshold for injury. With no high-pressure events in the near future, I'll hopefully be able to get in some decent training blocks, with the option to be flexible too.

### Aims
- Bikepacking - With some smaller sub-24hours under my belt, I really want to get some longer routes completed. No solid plans, but the South Downs Way with a overnight Bivi looks good as a starter. After that, maybe some of the shorter events from [The Racing Collective](https://www.theracingcollective.com/)
- Audaxes - Starting at 100k, hoping to increase to 200/300k by the end of the year.
- Cyclocross - No firm plans, but the Wessex Cyclocross league has some great beginner events.

### Winter plan
The plan for the winter is to keep up the same volume of training, but focus it more. I bought the cheapest turbo I could and put my CX bike on that, so will aim for a structure like so;

- 2-3 times (Monday-Friday): 1hr-1hr30 turbo training session. Based off of the [British Cycling Indoor Training Plans](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/knowledge/training-plans/supporting-documents/article/izn20140529-Indoor-Training-Sessions-0). Aim to train using Heart Rate, and build up power and good form (including improved cadence.)
- Weekend rides: Take the MTB out for a long ride. 30-60kms, aiming to build up base fitness, as well as on-bike conditioning. I'll be aiming for a mix of XC-style distance and trails, which should help with the conditioning.

### Into Spring
Heading into Spring, I'll hopefully have a decent base, with opportunity for time off due to Christmas, injuries or work trips. The plan then is to build up some long rides:

- [Dirty Santa](https://www.trailbreak.co.uk/dirty-santa-xmas-trail-ride/) - not really spring, but a decent MTB Event at the end of the season to get stuck into
- [Petworth Start of Summer Time 100](https://www.audax.uk/event-details?eventId=8142) - a 100k audax in the mid-spring, which should be a decent spring challenge for me.
- [2020 Surrey Hills Gravelcross](https://www.cxsportive.com/events/) - date tbc, but will be great to have another bash at it!
- [Pannier.cc Lakeland Pass Stormer](https://www.pannier.cc/product/lakeland-pass-storming-bikepacking-tour/) - Bikepacking weekender planned for September 2020.
